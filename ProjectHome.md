Stuff happens...

Whether it’s a new wireless network detected, a new Tweet or Facebook update that’s tagged you, or a new post in a blog you’ve subscribed to – there’s stuff going on all the time.  The problem is you spend all of your time trying to find out about it.

Snarl breaks this down into a simple statement:
```
{
  when stuff_happens()
  {
    tell_me();
  }
}
```
