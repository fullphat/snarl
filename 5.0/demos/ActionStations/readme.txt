[ A Snarl 5.0 Demonstration App ]


IMPORTANT
=========

THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH NO WARRANTY.  USE ONLY AS DIRECTED.


Synopsis
========

Demonstrates using libSnarlWin32 to include actions within notifications.  


Usage
=====

This demo mimics an ICBM launch monitoring station.  Much of the functionality of a real monitoring station (plume detection, meterological conditions, geospational positioning, etc.) is not included and is left as an exercise for the reader.  The core functionality is in place however.  

To start the monitoring system, click the "BOOT SYSTEM" button.  If a launch is detected (or a pigeon is interfering with the Internet) you will get an alert indicating what's wrong.  You can choose the course of action to take from the actions within the notification.
