	-----------------------

	- Alpha 3.  (41.8)

	- Now starts even if no WLAN devices detected.  Failing if no
	  devices dected was a good idea in theory but the problem is
	  with manual switches on laptops that effectively remove the
	  device from Windows.  (41.8)

	- Rebuilt with clean version of misc.resource.  (41.5)

	- Sensitivity setting is now 3 by default.  (41.5)
