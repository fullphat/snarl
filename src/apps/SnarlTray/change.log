	--------------------

	- For unrecognised device classes, SnarlWare will now first look in
	  .\customclasses.conf before giving up.  customclasses.conf is a
	  simple section-less config file with a single entry for every custom
	  class.  The format should be: <CLASS_GUID>=<CLASS_NAME> (both entries
	  must be in uppercase).  SnarlWare will use the subsequent CLASS_NAME
	  as the icon to display.  (Build 8)

	- Now listens for power suspends and resumes and ignores device changes
	  while the system is suspended.  This prevents flooding the user will
	  many notifications of devices being disconnected and connected during
	  the suspend/resume process.  Because Windows is a bit clunky when it
	  comes to notifying of power resumption (the notification is sent
	  before devices are enabled), SnarlWare will wait 3 seconds for the
	  system to settle before watching for device changes.  (Build 7)

	- Added rudimentary notification flood prevention by having SnarlWare
	  check the previous device it notified about (seperate entries for
	  connected and disconnected devices).  (Build 5)


	To Do
	-----

	- For processes which can't be queried, "source" should be the PID of
	  the process (so the user can look it up in Task Manager).
